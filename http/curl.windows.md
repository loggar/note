### git for windows

If you install Git for Windows you get Curl automatically too. There are some advantages:
* Git takes care of the PATH setup during installation automatically.
* You get the GNU bash, a really powerful shell, in my opinion much better than the native Windows console.
* You get many other useful Linux tools like tail, cat, grep, gzip, pdftotext, less, sort, tar, vim and even Perl.
