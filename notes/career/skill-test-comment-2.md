Hi .. ,

The CV showed me he had enough experience (5 years) in software-engineering field but the interview/skill-test explain he does not. I think the candidate would not be the best fit for the role.

I append the comments from the candidate's interview and skill-test.

Feedback from the interview:

- Candidate is considered as experienced in back-end side engineering focused on a limited environment.
- Candidate shows his lack of experience in front-end side engineering.

Feedback from the skill test:

Strengths:

- Got a quick understanding of Spring boots Application and its simple configuration.
- Got an understanding Object Builder Pattern and its practice.
- Simply well-applied Dependency Injection

Areas for Improvement:

- Did not cover tasks required: REST API Client including get, put methods.
- No Unit-Test, No Http-Connection-Test.
- No document for running the application / building project.
