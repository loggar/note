# terminal hacks

## go to begin, end

If you wrote a very long command in the terminal it may take a long time before you return to the begging of the line to add missing sudo. And back to the end to add some parameters.

Press `crtl + a` to move to the begging and `crtl + e` to the end of the line in terminal.
