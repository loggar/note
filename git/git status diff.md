## Git Status, Log and History

There a three essential git commands that give you a status of your project about current and recent changes. They donâ€™t alter anything in your local repository but only show you information. For instance, whenever you want to check the local staged and unstaged changes, type:

```
git status
```

Whenever you want to see your local unstaged changes compared to the recent commit, type:

```
git diff
```

And whenever you want to see the git history of commits, type:

```
git log
```

The default `git log` is not helpful for most people. Each commit takes too much space and it is hard to scan the history. You can use the following configuration to setup a more concise alias:

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

Now you can use it with `git lg` instead of `git log`. Try it out to see the difference.
