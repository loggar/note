Dear Dr. Sohail,

Good Afternoon, Shaleeza.

I am writing to you at the suggestion of Chandra (Deputy Dean) and Sunny (IT Assistant Manager) about appying Programming Tutor Roles.

I am a lead software engineer of KOI. I have been working for the company since 2016 and have 12 year experience in a range of software developing fields. Trainnig junior engineers also has been my area; I believe that delivering practical approaches and skills can be one of my strengths in the academic field.

It would be a great opportunity for me and my career if I could assist your lectures and researches.

I have attached my resume and please let me know if there is further information I can provide.

Thank you for your consideration.


Yours sincerely,
