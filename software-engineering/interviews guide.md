# Interviews

As you start your career in Software Engineering, you’ll have to face one indisputable fact. Interviews suck.

They can be awful for everybody involved. Having been both an interviewer and an interviewee, I can attest that interviews are a big time sink, extremely stressful and a really bad indicator of future job performance. Nevertheless, they are a necessary evil that you and your résumé better be prepared for.


## Preparing for Battle

If you're considering a career in Software Engineering, make sure to learn some of the most commonly asked programming interview questions, such as 'FizzBuzz':

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.

Sounds simple enough, right?

Well, the vast majority of interviewees fail this simple test, let alone its more complex variants.

I’ve personally seen many candidates for senior positions fail this test while having full internet access. So make sure that if a programming language is listed on your résumé, you know how to do at least FizzBuzz in it. Otherwise, you’re just wasting everybody’s time, including yours.

Of course, you’ll need to know more than just FizzBuzz to survive your interviews. You also need to make sure that you know:

- Basic data structures and algorithms: such as linked lists, arrays, trees and sorts.
- Common `gotchas` in your language of choice, such as whether strings are immutable, and how memory is managed.
- Object Oriented Programming concepts like class versus object, and inheritance.

At the beginning of your career, you’ll need to shine on these sorts of questions, since you don’t have the experiences to prove that you will be good at the job.

## Give yourself that extra edge

There are several things you can do that will give you that little something extra.

First, learn to communicate your experiences. You should have an elevator pitch that summarizes your resume into a coherent and engaging narrative.

In addition, know your own résumé! It sounds silly, but I’ve seen a lot of interviewees struggle to explain a particular item on their résumé. You should be able to answer questions about any experience that you list on your résumé and explain how it’s made you a better candidate for the job.

Next, have code samples to show on GitHub (or another public repository).

Seeing is believing, and interviewers being able to see your code will do wonders. Plus, it shows you have an understanding of version control systems.

The code samples don’t have to be anything too complex, but they do need to be clean and show good coding practices. This is your chance to show how you code without the time-pressure of a coding interview.

Once you’ve done all of the above, it’s time to consider participating in an open source project. It will show you can work in an existing code base and collaborate with other programmers.

This will be the closest you can get to programming in an industry environment without actually being in an industry environment. This is by far the hardest and time-consuming item so far, so reserve it until you’ve completed the lower hanging fruit I’ve discussed above.

## Interviewing your interviewer

In the rush and stress of the job hunt, many candidates forget that interviewing is a two-way street. As the company is trying to figure out whether you’re the right person for the job, you should be figuring out if the company is the right fit for you.

Make sure that you get to ask some of the questions below, even if it’s in a follow-up email. Be aware that often times, companies might try to spin not following best engineering practices as a perk, so read between the lines.

Here are some example questions you could ask:

> What would a typical workday look like for me?

It’s important to know what to expect from a particular position because Software Engineering jobs vary quite a bit. You might be expected to upkeep servers or talk to clients directly, for example.

> How do you test your software?

Ideally, a combination of unit testing, manual testing, and automated testing should be used to verify the quality of the code.

> What version control system do you use?

Version control systems are extremely useful for collaboration and there are zero reasons to not use one in a professional setting.

> Do you do peer reviews?

Peer reviews, or having someone else look at your code before it goes into the code base, is a fantastic way to spot silly mistakes and is a vital training opportunity when starting your career.

> What programs do you have for continuous education?

Being a software engineer means constantly learning as technologies appear, mature and become out-dated at a dizzying rate. As such, many companies have a training budget that they use to pay for university and online classes, conferences, or in-house talks.

> What’s the software development process that you use?

Process is vital to software engineering, regardless of the actual details. The particulars of what constitutes optimal process are subject to intense debate, but the mere existence of an agreed upon way of working on a project minimizes chaos and ensures everybody is on the same page.

> How do you tackle technical debt?

Technical debt is an accumulation of outdated technologies and quick-but-dirty solutions in the code base. Addressing it is important to the long-term health of the code and should be done on a continuous basis.

> What’s your company culture like?

Company culture might be a very vague concept, but even small things like an open office versus cubicles will change your day-to-day interaction with colleagues in significant ways. There are no general red flags, but make sure their answer is something you can live with for 40+ hours a week for years.
