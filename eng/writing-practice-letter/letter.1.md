Dear Mr. John Jones,

My name is Charlie Lee and I and my family just moved into your unit which is located near Central station and I am writing to complain about the poor conditions of the television cabinet and the wooden bookshelf in living room.

Last week, the cabinet seemed good until I set up my television but I soon found that it was rotting from the inside. I investigated the bookshelf next to the cabinet and could find that it also had a decayed back panel.

The rotten parts are considerably wide and they were breaking little by little as I tried to clean the serious spots. What concerns me is that the shelf could be dangerous for my little children as its standing balance may be vulnerable.

If you receive this letter, would you please remove these furnitures as soon as possible? In case you are not available, I would like you to allow me to get rid of them myself.

I look forward to be responded soon.

Yours sincerely,
