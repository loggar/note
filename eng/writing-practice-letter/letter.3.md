Dear Mrs. Smith,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inform that I need to withdraw from two courses. I am one of students who is studying Computer Science in your school.

I would like to explain the reason I need to cancel the courses. At the moment, I am working and my employer has offered me a full time position. The job will be from Monday to Friday and I should work with a shift position. Thus, it would be difficult to continue studying.

Let me enquire if it is possible to receive a refund. I have paid for the full tuition fee for this term. However, I only attended four classes. If you need a copy of the receipt, I can send it to you.

If you could advise me the steps to withdraw the courses, please let me know if I need to sign a cancellation form. I can visit the school any time next week.

I was very pleased that I joined your classes and it was very interesting.

Should you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
