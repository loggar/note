Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about some problem that I faced in your airport facility. I was one of the passengers who used your facility, and I was quite disappointed.

I would like to provide my flight information. My airline was Pacific Airline and the flight number was QF2. The flight departed Seoul, South Korea on the 5 March and landed in Sydney on the 6 March at 9 in the morning.

Let me explain what the issue I faced was. The airport was very untidy. When I arrived, there was rubbish on the floor in my areas. I tried to look for some cleaners but no one was available.

Allow me to recommend a few improvements for the future. First of all, please provide more rubbish bins, so passengers can dispose their waste easily. Also, please hire more cleaners to maintain your airport facility. I you do these, this problem will be prevented.

Please deal with this issue urgently.

Yours faithfully,
