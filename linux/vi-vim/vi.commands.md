| Commands are case sensitive                                                                                                | Shortcut keys are not case sensitive                                                        |
| Buffer                                                                                                                     | Document                                                                                    |
| Starts in Command mode                                                                                                     | Starts in Insert mode                                                                       |
| Press i, a, I, A to enter into Insert mode.                                                                                |
| You have to press one of these keys before text gets added to the document.                                                | Always in Insert mode, so you just keep typing to add text.                                 |
| Press ESC key to return to Command mode.                                                                                   |
| When in Insert mode, you have to press the ESC key before executing a command.                                             | Always in Insert mode. No mode switching is required. Shortcuts are active and can be used. |
| Commands do not work in Insert mode.                                                                                       | Shortcuts are active in Insert mode.                                                        |
| For copy/cut/paste, you can use the local clipboard or the system clipboard.                                               | Copy/cut/paste always uses the system clipboard                                             |
| Mouse and scroll wheel may not work to move the cursor. Have to use one of the many keyboard commands for cursor movement. | Mouse and scroll wheel works as expected.                                                   |

## Tips and Tricks

1. Startup configuration file

The `vimrc` file contains optional runtime configuration settings to initialize Vim when it starts. On Unix based systems, the file is named `.vimrc`, while on Windows systems it is named `_vimrc`. It's convenient to have some of the settings defined above on startup.

2. Tab settings

The default tab settings is 8 columns. Some conventions require it be 4 columns. This link, Secrets of tabs in vim, will help in adjusting the defaults.

3. Mapping keys

It means user defined shortcut keys. One good example is mapping to the Windows copy/cut/paste shortcut keys (since the Vim command is not convenient at all).

```
:map  "+y
:map  "+d
:map  "+p
```
