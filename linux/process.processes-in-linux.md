# Processes in Linux

## Types of Processes

1. Foreground processes (interactive processes)
2. Background processes (non-interactive processes)

`Demons`: Special type of background processes that starts at system startup and keep running as a service. They are started as system tasks (run as services), spontaneously.

## Processes are Categorized into:

- Parent Processes: create other processes during run-time.
- Child Processes: are created by other processes during run-time.
- The Init Process: is the parent of all processes on the system, PID 1, PPID 0.

To find the process ID and PPID of the `current shell`, run:

```
echo $$

echo $PPID
```

## ps

list processes

```
ps -lA
```

This may be too many processes to read at one time, so you can pipe the output through the less command to scroll through them at your own pace:

```
ps -lA | less
```

Press `q` to exit less.

You could also pipe the output through grep to search for a specific process without using any other commands. The following command would search for the Firefox process:

```
ps -lA | grep ps
```

## pgrep

Given a search term, pgrep returns the process IDs that match it. For example, you could use the following command to find Firefox’s PID:

```
pgrep firefox
```

You can also combine this command with kill to kill a specific process. Using pkill or killall is simpler, though.

```
kill $(pgrep firefox)
```

## monitoring processes

The pstree command is another way of visualizing processes.

```
pstree
```

The top command is the traditional way to view your system’s resource usage and see the processes that are taking up the most system resources. Top displays a list of processes, with the ones using the most CPU at the top.

```
top
```

To exit top or top, use the Ctrl-C keyboard shortcut.

The htop command is an improved top. It’s not installed by default on most Linux distributions — here’s the command you’ll need to install it on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install htop

htop
```

## kill

The kill command can kill a process, given its process ID. You can get this information from the ps -A, top or pgrep commands.

```
ps -lA | grep firefox

kill -9 1234
```

The `pkill` and `killall` commands can kill a process, given its name. Use either command to kill Firefox:

```
pkill firefox

killall firefox
```

## renice

The renice command changes the nice value of an already running process. The nice value determines what priority the process runs with. A value of -19 is very high priority, while a value of 19 is very low priority. A value of 0 is the default priority.

The renice command requires a process’s PID. The following command makes a process run with very low priority:

```
renice 19 PID
```

You can use the pgrep trick above with renice, too.

If you’re making a process run at a higher priority, you’ll require root permissions. On Ubuntu, use sudo for that:

```
sudo renice -19 #
```

## Starting a Process

start a foreground process

```
$ npm start
```

To start a process in the background, use `&` symbol.

```
$ npm start &

^C

$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 npm start &
```

To send a background process to the foreground:

```
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 npm start &

$ fg %1
```

- SIGHUP (1) - Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death - of controlling process.
- SIGINT (2) - Interrupt from keyboard.
- SIGKILL (9) - Kill signal i.e. kill running process.
- SIGSTOP (19) - Stop process.
- SIGCONT (18) - Continue process if stopped.

Examples:

```
kill -9 1234
kill -KILL 1234
kill -SIGKILL 1234
```
