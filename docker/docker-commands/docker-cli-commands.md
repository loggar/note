# Top 10 Docker CLI commands

1.  [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) — Lists running containers. Some useful flags include: `-a` / `-all` for all containers (default shows just running) and `—-quiet` /`-q` to list just their ids (useful for when you want to get all the containers).
2.  [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) — Most of your images will be created on top of a base image from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) contains many pre-built images that you can `pull` and try without needing to define and configure your own. To download a particular image, or set of images (i.e., a repository), use `docker pull`.
3.  [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) — The `docker build` command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context”. A build’s context is the set of files located in the specified `PATH` or `URL`. Use the `-t` flag to label the image, for example `docker build -t my_container .` with the `.` at the end signalling to build using the currently directory.
4.  [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) — Run a docker container based on an image, you can follow this on with other commands, such as `-it bash` to then run bash from within the container. _Also see_ [_Top 10 options for docker run — a quick reference guide for the CLI command_](https://medium.com/the-code-review/top-10-docker-run-command-options-you-cant-live-without-a-reference-d256834e86c1)_._ `docker run my_image -it bash`
5.  [docker logs ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)— Use this command to display the logs of a container, you must specify a container and can use flags, such as `--follow` to follow the output in the logs of using the program. `docker logs --follow my_container`
6.  [docker volume ls](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_ls/) — This lists the [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/), which are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
7.  [docker rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/) — Removes one or more containers. `docker rm my_container`
8.  [docker rmi ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi/)— Removes one or more images. `docker rmi my_image`
9.  [docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/) — Stops one or more containers. `docker stop my_container` stops one container, while `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)` stops all running containers. A more direct way is to use `docker kill my_container`, which does not attempt to shut down the process gracefully first.
10. Use them together, for example to clean up all your docker images and containers:

- kill all running containers with `docker kill $(docker ps -q)`
- delete all stopped containers with `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
- delete all images with `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`
