# docker commands

## exec

This is for when you want to run a command in an existing container. This is better if you already have a container running and want to change it or obtain something from it. For example, if you are using docker-compose you will probably spin-up multiple containers and you may want to access one or more of them once they are created.

```
docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
```

Docker `exec` also has a range of options and arguments you can specify, although you must state the container and command to execute. You can start an interactive bash shell on a container named `ubuntu_bash` using:

```
docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
```

Here the options `-it` have the same effect as with run. An example with more options and arguments is:

```
docker exec -d -w /temp ubuntu_bash touch my_file.sh
```

- `-w` followed by the directory or file path allows you to state which working directory you want to run the command in.
- `-d` or `-detached` means that the container will run in detached mode, so you can still continue to use your terminal session with the container running in the background. Donâ€™t use this if you want to see what the container sends to STDOUT.
- The command is `touch` used to create the file with the name `my_file.sh` inside the `/temp` directory of the running container `ubuntu_bash`
