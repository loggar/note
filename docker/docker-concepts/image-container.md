## Images and Containers

Docker images are executable packages that include everything needed to run an application — the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

Docker containers are a runtime instance of an image — what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process).

Docker images hold the snapshot of the Dockerfile, and the Docker container is a running implementation of a Docker image based on the instructions contained within that image.
