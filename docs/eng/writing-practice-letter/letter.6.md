Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to ask you to replace my earset which I have been using since last year with new one. I am Charly and work as a leader of the software development team in our company.

The earset has stopped working yesterday during an online meeting with my team members. It started making unpleasent noise at the begining of the meeting and soon being unable to send my voice to the others. Without this gear I cannot arrange any team meetings that are significant for the cycle of developing applications; we have an another important meeting plan on next Tuesday.

One of my junior engineer told me that Accounting team can provide us a new wireless headset which works fine and nice. I would like to ask you if I can have one. I will go to the office to bring my notes on Monday morning so you do not need to send it with a delivery service. I will visit your office before the lanch time.

I look forward to hearing from you, thank you kindly in advance for this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Charly Lee.
