Dear Mr Smith,

I hope this mail finds you well. 
I am writing this letter to ask you to consider hiring me for the hall manager position of your restaurant in Sydney city.

I am Charlie Lee and we met in the train that was travelling to Canberra from Sydney last year. You offered me a glass of red wind and introduced yourself as an owner of a chain of restaurants all around the country.

You also offered the manager role which was vacant at the moment as I told you that I was a hall manager of Four Seasons hotel. After saying that one of your restaurants in Sydney city was struggling with arranging hall service in high quality. We both agreed that I would fit for the position but I rejected your offer with respect because my contract with my hotel remained for years.

Unexpectedly the contract with Four Seasons hotel  has been terminated due to a reconstruction of the site, and I assure that I am a highly experienced one at large organisations who can fulfill your needs. If you are still looking for a hall manager, please contact me. I will regard your offer as the top priority of my next movement.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Smith,

I hope this letter finds you well.

This is Charlie, Lee who sat next to you on the plane from Canberra to Sydney a couple of weeks ago. Thanks for making the journey a pleasant one; I really enjoyed your company.

I have been thinking about your offer and am writing to you today to apply for the hall manager position of your restaurant in Rhodes. As I briefly mentioned then, I had been working for seven years in a restaurant in South Korea before I moved to Sydney. To my understanding, many of your customers at the restaurant in Rhodes are Koreans and I believe that my background as well as my experience will definitely fulfill your needs for the position.

I appreciate your time and consideration. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Charlie, Lee
