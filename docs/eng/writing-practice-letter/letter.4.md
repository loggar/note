Dear John,

I'm excited to know that you're coming to my town for a holiday. Unfortunately, I can't invite you to my home. Anyway, I'm sure you'll still have a great time.

As you know, I'm staying in a shared accommodation at the moment. I have a roommate and he's studying for university. More importantly, the landlord doesn't allow guests to stay over.

Don't worry. There are so many hotels and inns around my town. I can recommend Four Seasons Hotel which is located near Central Train Station. I've worked there before and I was impressed by their services. If you need help about booking, just let me know.

I know you'll be tire when you arrive, so we can meet the day after. I cant meet you at your hotel in the morning and I'd like to show you around my city. We can have lunch at a great Japanese restaurant. My treat!

I can't wait. Let's keep in touch.

Cheers,
