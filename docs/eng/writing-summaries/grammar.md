# Grammar

## How to win

To reach the required standard you must :
* use a variety of complex structures
* produce frequent error-free sentences
* show good control of grammar and punctuation(with possibly a few errors)

## Subject-Verb Agreement

**The basic rule here is that the subject and verb must agree in number.**

> A dog barks.

> Dogs bark.

This rule mainly affects present tense. For singular noun or pronoun subjects, it generally involves using verb forms ending in s, such as __is__, __has__, __does__ and adding __s__ to other verbs.

Occasionally __es__ is added, as in __rushes__, __passes__. Pronoun subjects that are 3<sup>rd</sup> person (she, he, it) are also treated in this way.

In past tense, only the verb 'to be' changes: I, she, he, it __was__; we, you, they __were__.

**With modal verbs,**

| present | past  |        |          |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| can     | could |        |          |
| may     | might |        |          |
| will    | would |        |          |
| must    | shall | should | ought to |

The 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular verb form is not used

> The Prime Minister __delivers__ a speech to the Parliament today.

> The Prime Minister may __deliver__ a speech to the Parliament today.

**Do not be confused by words that come between the subject and verb:**

> __Telecommuting__ not only enables companies to run more effectively, but ~~provide~~ __provides__ job satisfaction to workers as well.

**Caution:** The words __everyone__, __everybody__, __everything__, __each__ are singular and therefore take a singular verb:

> Everything is welcome at the event.

> Each person is welcome.

Also, if __every__ is used before a noun, the noun and the verb form must be singular:

> Every country has laws.

> Each person has a name.

## Plurals

Nouns are either singular or plural.

In English, the usual practice is to add __s__, or sometimes __es_ for the plural form. The usual error is a failure to pluralise the word, as in:

> Business ~~traveller~~ __travellers__ preferred to stay at ...

**Caution:** Despite the apparent simplicity of this rule, errors are frequent.

There are some irregular noun plurals, only some of which are included here:

| Singular   | Plural    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| woman      | women     |
| man        | men       |
| child      | children  |
| person     | people    |
| wife       | wives     |
| analysis   | analyses  |
| thesis     | theses    |
| criterion  | criteria  |
| phenomenon | phenomena |
| nucleus    | nuclei    |


**Caution:** Any phrase beginning with __One of ...__ must include a plural, as in:

> One of my friends ...

One of anything is one of a group of things/people (plural).

## Pronoun Agreement / Reference

**Pronouns must agree with the noun(s) they replace.**

The general rule is simple. If the noun is singular, the pronoun replacing the noun must also be singular, a plural noun needs a plural pronoun.

> The man contacted the police when __he__ saw the robbery.

> Although the __number__ decreased until 2010, __it__ reached 28000 in 2012.

> Although animal __tests__ save human lives, __their_ associated negative aspects are many.

> The __temperatures__ were highest in Mombasa from January to May. However, __they__ declined slightly to 75 degrees in July.

**Pronouns must have a clear reference.**

In the following examples there is no clear reference:

> I believe that families having fewer children is a positive development because __they__ can have more resources and contribute more. __(x)__

> The number of football players had the largest increase, but __its__ injury rate was the highest among all sports. __(x)__


## Sentence Fragments

Sometimes sentences are incomplete when conjunctions such as __Although, Because, Whereas, While...__ are used to start sentences. Such words are often used to join two parts of a sentence, as in the following example:

> The effects of climate change have been accelerating, __although__ it is not noticeable to the average person. __(o)__

The above sentence is grammatically correct. However, consider:

> The effects of climate change have been accelerating. <mark>Although it is not noticeable to the average person.</mark> __(x)__

The highlighted section doesn't contain a main clause. It cannot stand alone and it makes no sense in itself. However, you can start the sentence with __'Although'__, as long as you include the main clause:

> Although it is not noticeable to the average person, the effects of climate change have been accelerating. __(o)__

Sometimes a sentence with __'although'__ can be too long.

> Research studies in the UK, USA and Canada have consistently shown that the effects of climate change have been accelerating, especially in developing countries since 2000, although it is not noticeable to the average person. __(x)__

This sentence is grammatical but has 34 words, and this is not good practice, In a case like this there can be a tendency to separate the final phrase:

> Although it is not noticeable to the average person. __(x)__

However, the sentence fragment is not acceptable. It would be best to use an alternative structure:

> However, it is not noticeable to the average person. __(o)__

This is a complete sentence. Note that a comma is used after __However__ but not after __Although.__

The examples in this section use the word __although__, but the same principles apply when you use other subordinating conjunctions, such as __because, while, since, whereas, even though ...__

If you start a sentence with one of these just ensure you include a main clause (that is , a clause that can stand alone as a sentence).

When using any of these words to start a sentence __do not__ follow it with a comma.

## Comma Splices

A comma splice describes what occurs when two main clauses are incorrectly joined using only a comma.

> The meeting will be held tomorrow, it is important that everyone is present. __(x)__

> Unemployment is rising rapidly, the government needs to take action now. __(x)__

The problem is that the comma is inadequate as a link, because the two parts actually qualified individually as complete sentences. However, there are three fairly simple strategies to fix comma splice problems:

1. Insert a full stop and start a new sentence
	> The meeting will be held tomorrow<mark>. It is</mark> important that everyone is present. __(o)__
	
	> Unemployment is rising rapidly<mark>. The</mark> government needs to take action now. __(o)__

2. Insert an appropriate link word after the comma __(and, but, for, so, or, yet, nor)__
	> The meeting will be held tomorrow, <mark>and</mark> it is important that everyone is present. __(o)__

	> Unemployment is rising rapidly, <mark>so</mark> the government needs to take action now. __(o)__

3. Substitute a semi-colon for the comma
	> The meeting will be held tomorrow<mark>;</mark> it is important that everyone is present __(o)__

	> Unemployment is rising rapidly<mark>;</mark> the government needs to take action now. __(o)__
	
	Use this only when the two clauses are closely related, but not if the sentence would be too long.

**Caution:** when using __however__ or __therefore__ to join two clauses use a semi-colon or full stop. A comma is not adequate.

> Parents often work hard to provide their child with a first-class education<mark>;</mark> however, their health may suffer as a result. __(o)__

> In recent years, pollution has become a major problem in most countries<mark>.</mark> Therefore, it is imperative that governments act now to combat the problem. __(o)__

## Usage of 'Which'

The main problem here is that in may cases __which__ does not clearly relate to what is intended:

> Tokyo subway has the largest carrying capacity, which serves many more passengers than other subways each year. __(x)__

> The largest carrying capacity is held by <mark>Tokyo subway, which</mark> serves many more passengers than other subways each year. __(o)__

> Tokyo subway has the largest <mark>carrying capacity, which</mark> is 1900 million people per annum. __(o)__

**Tip:** Ensure __which__ immediately follows the noun/noun phrase to which it refers and is separated by a comma.

Sometimes, __which__ may refer to the whole of a previous clause.

> He hot married again a year later, which surprised everybody. __(o)__

In this case, there is also a comma before 'which'.

**Caution:** Sometimes, __which__ is used in what is called a 'defining' or 'identifying' clause.

Consider the difference between these two examples:

> The complaints, which were less than 60 days old<mark>,</mark> were dealt with by the company.

> the complaints which were less than 60 days old were dealt with the company.

Both are grammatically correct but have different meanings.

In the first example, all complaints were dealt with and all were less than 60 days old.

In the second example, we know that only those complaints which were less than 60 days old were dealt with.

Note that a comma is not used before __which__ in the second example.

Unlike the earlier examples, the second one here contains an identifying clause. It identifies or defines the types of complaints that were dealt with.
