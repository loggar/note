# Writing Task 1 - A letter

## Purpose

This must be clearly presented, and is best stated in the first paragraph.

> I'm writing to invite you to attend a cookery course with me at our local college.

> I'm writing to request a replacement for my student card that I lost last week.

The purpose statement should be clear and not accompanied by a lot of detail. In fact, in a formal letter it is usually best that the first paragraph consists of just this one sentence.

**Do not** clutter this paragraph with detail as the purpose will become less clear.
In the informal letter it may be appropriate to include a friendly greeting prior to the purpose, for example: **I hope you're well**. But **Do not** include lengthy or irrelevant 'chat'.


## Tone

The tone must be appropriate for the situation and consistent throughout the letter.

In a letter to a friend you may wish to use a 'chatty' style. If appropriate, fine, but keep it that way throughout. To assist, you could use contractions, such as **I'm, we'll, you're ...** Your writing will more closely correspond to a spoken conversation. In this case the closing formula should not use formal words, such as **Yours faithfully** or **Yours sincerely**. Expressions such as **Regards, Cheers, Best wishes** would usually be appropriate.

When making a request it is also more polite to write **I would like ...** than **I want ...**

In a formal letter you should stay task-oriented and not show emotion.

**Do not** make abusive statements or threaten legal action if making a complaint.


## Salutation

For an **informal** letter, start by writing the name of your friend, for example : **Dear John.** It may be appropriate to use the family name, such as in **Dear Ms Jones** for a letter to a former teacher, or as a mark of respect for a friend much older than you.

In other cases you may be asked to write to 'friends (plural)'. If so, you would need the names of two friends, for example: **Dear Jack and Gill.**

For a formal letter, start by writing **Dear Sir or Madam** (as instructed).

**Do not** write **Dear friend** or **Dear Manager** or Dear **Accommodation Officer.**


## Close

In an **informal** letter **Yours sincerely** may still be appropriate if that degree of formality is in keeping with the overall tone, but you can use **Regards**, **Kind regards**, possibly **Cheers**, **Best wishes** or even **Love** if appropriate to the tone of the letter.

In a **formal** letter use either **Yours sincerely** or **Yours faithfully**.

In a **semi-formal** letter **Regards**, **Kind regards** or **Yours sincerely** would be appropriate.

You should write your name (or name and signature) below the closing formula.


## Coverage of bullet points

All bullet points must be covered, and the fullness of this coverage is also important. However, some may require more content than others.

**Do not** include irrelevant information.

Information presented should be complete. Not covering any bullet point, or part thereof will result in a lower mark. Although not essential, cover the bullet points in the order presented. By keeping to this order you will be less likely to omit information, because you are more organised in your approach.

**Caution** : Some bullet points may require coverage of more than one item. Be very alert for this before beginning your answer.

Be **clear** and **specific** about what you are suggesting. **Do not** make vague suggestions.

> I suggest you make changes to improve this situation. **(x)**

> I suggest you install playground equipment and provide seating in the park. **(o)**


## Logical organisation and progression

State your purpose clearly and then deal fully with all bullet points. There is no rule that you must follow the order given. However the third bullet point often suggests future action and if so is best dealt with last. Unless there is good reason for changing the order, **deal with the bullet points in the order shown,** providing a paragraph for each bullet point.

**Clear progression** can be hindered by over-long sentences, or too many short sentences.
Balance longer sentences with shorter ones. Two short sentences together (less than 10 words each) would probably be best combined. There is no compulsory maximum, but aim at a maximum of about 20-25 words per sentence and an average of 14-18 words.

1. A letter is very conversational in style and we do not speak in very long sentences
2. Grammar errors become more likely in long sentences
3. Long sentences may could the reader's understanding

Aim to include a **variety** of sentence **structures** and **lengths**.

**Sentence openings** should have **variety**. This can be achieved by changing the order of words or making your point in another way. There is a tendency in letter writing to start successive sentences with the pronoun **I,** and this is best **avoided**.

**Paragraphing** : Use 4 or 5 paragraphs. Leave one blank line between paragraphs. This gives a better impression and avoids confusion about where the next paragraph starts.

**Cohesive devices** : There are words or phrases used to connect ideas together.

* **Pronouns**, such as **this, that, those, he, she, it, they, we** are useful in making references to something from a previous sentence.
* **Conjunctions**, such as **and** and **but** can also link ideas within sentences and assist in forming complex sentences.
* **Discourse markers**, for example **however, moreover, nevertheless ...** can help to clarify relationships. Be aware that they will not help improving your letter's quality if you overuse them or use them inaccurately.

**Do not** use bullet / numbered points in your letter, and **do not** use a subject line.


## Variety

Try to avoid repetition of the same words or phrases. This does not always mean finding a synonym. Other techniques that often work better include **omission of the repeated word**, or simple substitution - **using pronouns** to replace nouns.

In letters the word 'I' tends to be over-used to open sentences.

> I purchased a student parking permit from Student Services a month ago. I received the permission a week later. I thought at first that the parking permit would make my college life much easier. I was very disappointed with the result. I spent an hour looking for a space last Monday and consequently arrived late for my class. I could not find a parking space again last Friday, even though I arrived forty minutes earlier.

In various ways this passage is improved :

> I purchased a student parking permit form Student Services a month aho and received the permission a week later. At the first I thought the parking permit would make my college life much easier. The result was very disappointing. After spending an hour looking for a parking space last Monday I arrived late for my class. Again last Friday, no space was available, even though I arrived forty minutes earlier.

We sometimes favour certain words and tend to overuse them. As you practice, identify these words and look up alternatives that could also be used.


## Appropriateness

**Do not** use big words in the letter because you think they might impress the examiner.

While some use of less common vocabulary expected, you need to use language you are **familiar with**.

Remember, You are not writing to an examiner. You are writing to a person (as specified in the task statement). Big or unfamiliar words may

* not be appropriate
* not mean what you think they mean
* require a linking word
* be misspelled

Give your letter the **conversation test**. Read it and ask yourself if you could actually **say** this to your reader. Your vocabulary should be appropriate for the specific situation. People have conversations in 'plain English', and your writing should 'speak' directly to the person.

Wordiness and impersonal, stuffy writing are simply not appropriate. In choosing words, the main consideration is 'What will be clearest for the reader?'

Using **plain English** is not about reducing the standard or quality of communication. It is about improving it by using language that is clear, simple, direct, personal, and appropriate for the reader and purpose of your letter.

## Precision

Avoid wordiness. The inclusion of unnecessary words destroys precision and can make your meaning less clear.

| **x**                        | **o**   |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| at the present time          | now     |
| in the vent of               | if      |
| in the majority of instances | usually |
| due to the fact that         | because |

In a letter, it is wise to be specific (rather than general). For example, a bullet point my ask you to suggest what should be done about something.

> I would like to propose that a more suitable development be undertaken. **(x)**

> I suggest a children's play area be built, together with seating and barbecue facilities. **(o)**

If you are asked to suggest a meeting, say where and when you could meet.

> If you're free, let's meet to discuss this at my place on Saturday at about 1 pm.

**Do not** make vague suggestions.

Say exactly what you would like the receiver of your letter to do.

In the final paragraph of letters, mistakes are frequently made with the following expressions :  

| These are correct versions :             |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| It would be appreciated if you would ... |
| I would appreciate it if you would ...   |
| I would be grateful if you would ...     |
| I hope to hear from you soon.            |
| I look forward to hearing from you soon. |
| I look forward to seeing you in Sydney.  |

## Informal letter

Dear Gill

I want to let you know about this great opportunity for us to see Jimmy Carlson live in a concert in Newcastle.

Remember how we both loved his concert when he came to our country three years ago? Well we shouldn't miss this chance as it looks like being his final tour. I just can't wait to see him, and the good news is that I've got two free tickets!

The concert is at the Entertainment Centre in Newcastle next Saturday and starts at 8 pm. It will take a while to get there as Newcastle is about 200 km away. Taking the train would probably be our best option. I checked the timetable and we'd need to catch the 5 pm train, which stops right at the Entertainment Centre. We can also stay that night at my aunt's place in Newcastle.

Let's meet to discuss this idea. Friday for dinner? Let me know if you're free and I'll make a booking at Ronald's for 7 pm.

Love

Jenny

## Formal letter

Dear Sir or Madam

I'm writing to request your help in arranging accommodation for when I attend a training course at your college in the near future.

I am an overseas student from Korea and have enrolled in your International Accounting course. I have not visited Australia before and am asking for your assistance as i do not have any contacts in your country that could help me.

My preference is for self-contained accommodation near the college, because this would be very convenient for attending classes and using the college library. I don't mind sharing, but prefer to share with English-speaking students during my stay. Improving my language skills is important to me. It would also be good if I could have access to cooking facilities.

The course starts on 1 September and runs until 30 November. Accommodation is required for that period and for one week after the finish of the course.

I really hope you can help me and I look forward to receiving your reply.

Yours faithfully

First name and Family name
