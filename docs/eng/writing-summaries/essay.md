# Writing Task 2 - An essay

## Task achievement

* Write minimum of 250 words
* Address all parts of the task
* Present a clear position throughout
* Present, extend and support main ideas

## Address all parts of the task

Before writing, study the task carefully to ensure you understand it and its parts. Write a brief outline plan, with key points. Some tasks have two questions/instructions and you must answer both.


All tasks require you to :

> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

This is important. You must give reasons, and your own experience/knowledge (as a student, a traveller, a worker / in communicating, in a family, in another country ...) can be extremely helpful in responding. Do not disregard the value of your own experience. You are not expected to be an expert on any topic.

If a question asks about 'causes' or 'reasons' don't write about 'effects', or 'problems'.

> **causes / reasons** occur before an event

> **effects / problems** occur after an event

Also, if a question uses a plural noun, for example: **causes**, you should discuss a minimum of two examples.

## Present a clear position throughout

It is vital that whatever you write does not contain contradictory statements or ambiguities. The reader must be clear whether views expressed are those of other people or your own. You must be consistent in your approach. If you write a sentence which suggests agreement with an idea but you later seem to take a different view then the score would suffer.

Where you stand in relation to views expressed must be clear and so must your own view where it is relevant to include it.

## Present, extend and support main ideas

You do not need many ideas, but it is important that when you introduce an idea you follow it up with some explanation and evidence. The support could come from

* personal experience
* a research study
* statistical evidence
* expert opinion
* logical argument
* a case study

Do not provide a virtual list by writing one sentence on each of several solutions.

It is much better to just present say, two solutions, but in some depth. The depth is achieved by explaining **how** and **why** each would work, perhaps even providing an example from the past or about a particular place.

The ideas themselves are not being examined, but clearly they must have some relevance.

## Logical organisation and clear progression

This is essential and the approach required can differ somewhat according to the type of essay task.

Essays comprise a series of paragraphs, which should have their own unity and contribute to the writer's purpose. A common paragraph structure has :

* a topic sentence - the main point of the paragraph
* supporting sentences that expand further on this point. They may use explanation and/or examples to illustrate.

**Clear progression** can be hindered by over-long sentences, or too many short sentences.
Balance longer sentences with shorter ones. Two short sentences together (less than 10 words each) would probably be best combined. There is no compulsory maximum, but aim at a maximum of about 20-25 words per sentence and an average of 14-18 words.

If sentences follow a repetitive structure this will also disrupt the flow of your essay. You should include a variety of sentence structures. A good technique is to vary **sentence openings**. If you practise opening successive sentences with different part of speech you can improve progression.

**Cohesive devices** : There are words or phrases used to connect ideas together.

* **Pronouns**, such as **this, that, those, he, she, it, they, we** are useful in making references to something from a previous sentence.
* **Conjunctions**, such as **and** and **but** can also link ideas within sentences and assist in forming complex sentences.
* **Discourse markers**, for example **however, moreover, nevertheless ...** can help to clarify relationships. Be aware that they will not help improving your letter's quality if you overuse them or use them inaccurately.

## Variety

Try to avoid repetition of the same words or phrases. This does not always mean finding a synonym. Verbs, adjectives and adverbs can be fairly varied, but some commonly used nouns, such as **people** and **children** for example, do not have exact synonyms. **Restructuring** the sentence can help, and repetition can often be minimised by **omission**, or **substitution** (use of pronouns).

> Children who are keen to win are more determined than others, and as a result ~~these children~~ cannot be easily defeated by difficulties. Moreover, children get used to coping with strains and stresses through competing, which ~~children~~ **they** learn as preparation for an adult life that is full of pressure.

We sometimes favour certain words and tend to overuse them. As you practise, identify these words and look up alternatives that could also be used.

## Appropriateness

Use language that is appropriate for an academic test. Using plain English is not about reducing the standard or quality of communication. It is about improving it by using language that is clear, simple, direct, and appropriate to the reader and purpose of your writing.

Do not use big words because you think they might impress the examiner.

While some use of less common vocabulary is expected, use language you are **familiar** with.
Only use vocabulary that you are sure is correct, because using unfamiliar language can prove disastrous.

Low-frequency words, or big words, will not in themselves increase your score. It is a high-risk strategy. Their use is often seen as pretentious and aiming to 'impress' rather than clearly address the issue.

In choosing words, the main consideration is 'What will be **clearest** for the reader?'

Avoid over-use of personal pronouns. This does not mean that they should not be used at all. In fact, in some cases not doing so may incur a penalty. The tasks often ask you to give your view and it is perfectly appropriate to write : 

> My view is that ...

or 

> I strongly believe that ...

However, continuing personal references are unnecessary. Having stated your view let the evidence you present support it.

Do not use the 2<sup>nd</sup> person pronouns **you** or **your** in the essay. The pronoun **we** or **our** may be appropriate when used to include a whole society.

> **we** must act immediately to address the effects of climate change. **(o)**

## Precision

Avoid wordiness. The inclusion of unnecessary words destroys precision and can make your meaning less clear.

| **x**                        | **o**   |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| at the present time          | now     |
| in the vent of               | if      |
| in the majority of instances | usually |
| due to the fact that         | because |

Words from a thesaurus may be similar or related to a given word. However, they may not be identical or equivalent in meaning. Rely on **familiar** words rather than take risks.

For a more effective introduction, relate your comment to the issue itself.

> What we teach our children can have enormous effects for them and for society. **(o)**

Avoid redundancy (words or phrases that add nothing to what has already been said).

> In my view I think that ... **(x)**

> In my view ... **(o)**

In formal writing, nouns are often wrongly preferred to verbs.

> the government made a proposal for an alternative plan. **(x)**

> The government proposed an alternative plan **(o)**

Accurate spelling is also important. If unsure of the spelling during the game it may be best to choose a different word.

## Uncountable nouns

Uncountable nouns are materials, concepts and information which are not individual objects and cannot be counted. Simple examples include **water** and **milk**.

Most are singular and take a singular verb :

> Research is needed ...

We can use **some, any, a little, a lot of, much** with singular uncountable nouns.

Only a few uncountable nouns are plural, and these include **police** and **clothes**.

there are two issues here cause problems for essay writing : 

* It can be difficult to know which nouns are uncountable and have no plural form. In essays we often deal with concepts and abstract nouns such as **happiness** and **anger**, and these are often uncountable. A few examples of these appear below (always singular, uncountable) :

| uncountable concepts |              |           |               |             |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| accommodation        | advertising  | education | entertainment | equipment   |
| evidence             | convenience  | happiness | health        | homework    |
| information          | intelligence | justice   | knowledge     | legislation |
| luggage              | pollution    | poverty   | progress      | recognition |
| research             | traffic      | violence  | wealth        | weather     |

* Some nouns change their nature. They sometimes act as countable and sometimes uncountable. We might speak of a concept in **general**, but at other times in relation to **specific** instances : 

> It is difficult to get a job without **experience**. (uncountable / experience in general) **(o)**

> He has had three different work **experiences**. (countable / specific experiences) **(o)**

The same could apply for many other words, including **communication, conflict, failure, success, technology** ...

**Tip : ** When in doubt, try saying **'in general'** after the word. If it sounds correct, use the uncountable version (no **s**).
