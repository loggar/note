The issue on wildlife extinction has been receiving an increasing level of attention from contemporary society. The purpose of this essay is to take a close look at the factors of this issue; moreover, this paper will present a social perspective in examining measures to this trend.

To begin, the phenomenon of declining species can be attributed to a number of reasons. Fist and foremost, the most obvious is the fact that it has become possible for people to consume too much natural resource in modern times. This means that individuals cut trees and clear the forest to obtain raw materials. Ultimately, this reduces habitats around the world.

In addition, another cause that needs to be mentioned is the fact that people pollute natural areas. Case in point, factories produce high level of toxic wastes and emissions. As an effect, this kills many species of plants and animals.

On the other hand, along with the previous arguments, it is important to consider the solutions to this issue. For one, it would be unreasonable to ignore the possibility that the government must restrict people from using too much resources. In other words, the state should prevent deforestation in order to address this situation. Furthermore, another thing that needs to be mentioned is the fact that citizens need to support conservation programs of animal and plant species. To illustrate, individuals should send donations to breeding centres to support the protection of endangered animals.

By and large, there seems to be various causes to this trend, top of which are overconsumption of resources and pollution. However, the solutions are restriction of using resources and prevention of deforestation.
