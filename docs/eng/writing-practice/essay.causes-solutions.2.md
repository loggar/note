Many countries increase the amount of household garbage going to landfills every year.
What are the causes? What can be done to reduce it?

The issue on rising quantity of residential waste has been receiving an increasing level of attention from contemporary society. The purpose of this essay is to take a close look at the factors of this issue; moreover, this paper will present a social perspective in examining measures to this trend.

To begin, the phenomenon of growing quantity of domestic garbage can be attributed to a number of reasons. First and foremost, the most obvious is the fact that it has become possible for individuals who have hectic lives to consume disposable products in modern times. This means that such people purchase plastic containers and paper cups because of convenience. Ultimately, this increases the problem of pollution.

In addition, another cause that needs to be mentioned is the fact that industries who create goods use excessive packaging for their products. Case in point, such companies use a large amount of cardboard and styrofoam for protection or decoration. As an effect, this uses too much natural resources and produces a lot of rubbish as well.

On the other hand, along with the previous arguments, it is important to consider the solutions to this issue. For one, it would be unreasonable to ignore the possibility that national leaders should encourage people to use reusable containers. In other words, shops should offer a discount to customers who use their own containers in order to address this situation. Furthermore, another thing that needs to be mentioned is the fact that public officials should restrict companies from using excessive packaging. To illustrate, such people have to raise taxes on packaging materials.

By and large, there seems to be various causes to this trend, top of which are consuming disposable products and using excessive packaging. However, the solutions are encouraging individuals to use reusable containers and restricting companies from using excessive packaging.
