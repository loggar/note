## Issues

### Invalid plugin descriptor

```
File '~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/GoLand2024.1/plugins/space/lib/space.jar' contains invalid plugin descriptor
```

Resolution:

```
Could you share what output you get when you run that command? This will help me understand if Docker's binary is in the expected location or if we need to look elsewhere.
```
