🔍 (Magnifying Glass Tilted Left) - Improving searchability or traceability: This could be a good choice if your trace logic addition is primarily aimed at making it easier to trace how data flows through the feature or to identify where issues may arise.

✨ (Sparkles) - Introducing new features or improvements: If your trace logic adds significant value or improvements to the existing feature, such as enabling better performance monitoring or enhancing the user's ability to debug, this gitmoji might be suitable.

🩹 (Adhesive Bandage) - Simple fix for a non-critical issue: If the trace logic is added to address a minor issue or to slightly improve the feature without adding new functionality, this could be the right choice.

🚀 (Rocket) - Deploying stuff or improving the CI/CD: If your trace logic is closely tied to deployment processes, performance monitoring, or CI/CD improvements, this gitmoji can be appropriate.

📈 (Chart Increasing) - Adding analytics or tracking code: While typically used for analytics, this emoji could also be relevant if the trace logic is meant to gather data for performance metrics or usage patterns.

♻️ (Recycling Symbol) - Refactoring code: If adding trace logic involves a significant amount of code change that improves the structure and readability without changing the external behavior, this might be a fit.

🍱 (Bento Box) - Adding or updating assets. Use this if your trace logic involves adding new assets or files that are considered assets to the project.

🔧 (Wrench) - Changing configuration files. Suitable if your trace logic requires changes to configuration files to enable or adjust the tracing capabilities.

🚧 (Construction) - Work in progress. Use this for commits that are part of a larger piece of work, which might not be complete yet but you still want to share or merge incrementally.

🌐 (Globe with Meridians) - Internationalization and localization. If your trace logic includes modifications for supporting multiple languages or regions, this gitmoji is appropriate.

🔊 (Loud Sound) - Adding logs. Perfect for when your changes primarily involve adding logging for better visibility into the application's behavior.

🔇 (Muted Speaker) - Removing logs. Use this if your trace logic includes the removal of unnecessary or verbose logging.

🧹 (Broom) - General cleanup. Suitable for commits that clean up code, such as removing unused code or refactoring without significant changes to functionality.

⚡️ (High Voltage) - Improving performance. If your trace logic is part of performance optimization efforts, this gitmoji conveys that intent clearly.

🚚 (Moving Truck) - Moving or renaming files. Use this if your work involves reorganizing the code structure by moving or renaming files as part of adding trace logic.

📝 (Memo) - Writing docs. Appropriate for commits that include updates or additions to documentation, possibly explaining the trace logic or how to use it.

When choosing a gitmoji for your pull request, consider what aspect of your changes you want to highlight. This selection covers a range of scenarios, from adding new features or improvements (✨) to more specific actions like adding logs (🔊) or changing configuration files (🔧). The key is to match the emoji with the primary impact or intent of your changes, ensuring clarity and effective communication with your team.
