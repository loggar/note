## Focus on the test input, then handle edge cases (exceptional cases)

## Make it readable

## Follow the programing style of your language

## It is OK to get help

## Carefully review and refactor your solution

Your coding challenge is finally finished. After hours or even days of grueling concentration, it might b extremely tempting to close your IDE, zip up your code, and mail it to your recruiter just to get it all over and done with, Resist the urge. Instead, take the time to refactor your solution, check it carefully for error, and go over the Readme again. A silly mistake left in your code like a redundant variable assignment or unused method or function can make the reviewer feel like you either don't understand how programming works, or you don't care about your code. Don't let any of these silly mistakes make it into your fianl submission.

## Be prepared for a code review and constructive criticism

What happens if your coding challenge solution is good enough to reach the next stage? In many cases, the next step will involve a review of your coding challenge. This could be anything from a discussion with your recuiter over the phone, to a paring interview whwere you're challenged to extend your solution to deal with new reqirements. None of us write perfect code, and reviewer will almost always have some criticisms of your code. Don't be too afraid of this. In most cases, the reviewers want to see that you can take feedback on board and don't react too defensively. Remember, you are not your code.

## Regardless of the outcome, appreciate the experience

Even if you don't make it pass the coding challenge of the interview process, don't be too disheartened. Going through a coding challenge is a great way to hone your skills, and get feedback from professional software developers. Know that you're a better developer for having completed the challenge, and take what you learned to the next one.
