# MacOS

## Default apps

You can set macOS to open specific extension files with certain applications permanently by following these steps:

1. Finder:

Open a Finder window on your Mac.

2. Locate a file:

Navigate to a file with the extension you want to associate with a specific app.

3. Get Info:

Right-click (or Control-click) on the file.
Select "Get Info" from the context menu.

4. Open With:

In the Get Info window, locate the "Open With" section.
Click the arrow next to the current default application displayed.

5. Choose Application:

A list of applications that can potentially open the file format will be displayed.
If the desired application is present in the list, select it.

6. Change All (Optional):

Important: This step is crucial for permanently associating the file extension with the chosen application.
Check the box next to "Change All..." located below the application list.

7. Confirmation:

A confirmation dialog might appear asking if you want to change the default application for all files with this extension.
Click "Change All" to confirm.

8. Done!

Now, all files with that specific extension will open with the chosen application by default.

Additional Notes:

If the desired application isn't listed in the initial options, you can click "Other..." and navigate to the application on your computer to select it.
Make sure the chosen application has the capability to open the file format.
You can repeat this process for different file extensions and their corresponding applications.
