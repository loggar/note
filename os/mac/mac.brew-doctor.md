# brew doctor

## Check Formulae Usage

```
brew uses openssl@1.1 --installed
```

## Installing Formulae

### awscli

Issue:

```
Warning: Some installed kegs have no formulae!
This means they were either deleted or installed manually.
You should find replacements for the following formulae:
  pycparser
  cffi
```

Update Homebrew core:
In this case, there were missing formula files in /Formula directory

- `Formula/pycparser.rb`
- `Formula/cffi.rb`

```
$ cd /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core
$ git pull origin master
```

## cask

```
 $ brew doctor

Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!

Warning: You have an unnecessary local Cask tap.
This can cause problems installing up-to-date casks.
Please remove it by running:
  brew untap homebrew/cask

Warning: You have an unnecessary local Core tap!
This can cause problems installing up-to-date formulae.
Please remove it by running:
 brew untap homebrew/core
```

```
$ brew untap homebrew/cask
$ brew untap homebrew/core
```

## unlinked kegs

```
Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar.
Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause formulae that depend on
those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:
  docutils

brew doctor didn't pass.
```

You can resolve this issue by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ brew link docutils
```

This command will create the necessary symbolic links for the docutils package in /usr/local.

If you encounter permission issues while running the brew link command, you can try to force the link using:

```
$ brew link --overwrite docutils
```

This command will overwrite existing files.

Link all kegs at once:

```sh
for keg in python-packaging pycparser python-dateutil python-urllib3 python-charset-normalizer; do
  brew link $keg
done
```

If the issue still persists, you might need to change the ownership of the directories Homebrew is trying to write to. This can be done with the following command:

```
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
```

This command changes the ownership of the Homebrew directory to the current user, which should resolve any permission-related issues. Note that using sudo with Homebrew is generally not recommended, so use this as a last resort, and only after understanding the implications.
